# CenterWin

The CenterWin is a small and very simple utility that resizes and centers the foreground window in the monitor on which it is shown. Sizeable windows are resized to 95% of the monitor size. Maximized windows are restored. Non-sizeable windows are just moved so that they are fully inside the current monitor.

This is useful when you use different monitor configurations, but the programs always position themselves for the old configuration.

You can assign a hotkey in PowerToys Run to start it.
